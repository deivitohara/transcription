1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,920
We'll have the first girl who does the

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,640
raw materials thing, okay?  It is

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,840
true that he works in Paris for Al

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,639
Mundi for the hedge fund

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,400
 

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,320
and

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,640
the first thing that comes from V is that he

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,960
knows something about markets, but he comes from the

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,960
stocks side rather than from this

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,920
 

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,079
raw materials thing.  Nothing, folks,

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,640
the little trader who likes

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:38,960
cocoa finally made it to the end, right?  Bring the cocoa.   I still can't

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,960

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,039
hear you very well, okay?  You have the microphone

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,160
above your ear.

17
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,800
Sorry, now I'm right.

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,280
Yes, now we're talking.

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,079
Now yes.

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,719
No, he likes everything.

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,320
He likes everything.

22
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:52,840
Luckily, he eats everything.

23
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,000
Good, good, good, good, good.  I mean, let's

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,879
see if he likes the cocoa market now.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,840
The cocoa market or one of these

26
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:02,480
special ones, you know?

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,000
Completely.   Well then

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,000
.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,280
Oh, folks,

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,840
the end of the year has arrived, it's here and it's coming.  Okay,

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,119
I'm happy.  I don't know if the new ones are

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,360
with the Preds, or if the old ones who are

33
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:18,080
here are older now, since more years have passed.  I think

34
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,040
that this year, at least for me, has been a pretty

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,240

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,799
positive year.  Me, me, me,

37
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,560
for my first year to be

38
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,600
spectacular.

39
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, Fidel, what do you say?

40
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,439
No, except when I closed the princesses

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
at the beginning of the pigs and the cows and

42
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,720
the rice that has stuck to me and is still sticking to me

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,399
in a really great way, but well

44
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,240
, otherwise fine, very good.

45
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:46,600
Well,

46
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,759
at least in Santander you don't eat

47
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,600
much rice, so I don't know why

48
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,560
a Valencian gets hooked on rice and has to

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,759
face a paella every Sunday

50
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,000
.  It's a real bummer, you know what I

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,079
mean?  To say, [laughs] he says, "I do

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,759
n't feel like making a steak

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,560
because the pigs or the cows have at

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,039
least put some money in my

55
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,800
pocket, right? [laughs]

56
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:14,519
Oh, no. Well, but let's see, it's the

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,280
first year and I think it's been a good year,

58
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:17,560
from a trading point of view

59
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,760
, because last year

60
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,080
started well for us and we got really hooked on

61
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,959

62
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:30,480
cocoa, okay? And that put more than one person in their place,

63
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,879
some very firmly, and that's not

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,680
positive, okay? It's not so

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,440
positive.

66
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,000
Let me just send one thing, because tomorrow I

67
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,560
have to go 700 km to sign a

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,040
deed and it's really getting on my nerves.

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,040
Oh, but wait, let me tell the guy.

70
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Oh.

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,400
Oh, there. That's it. And what I mean is,

72
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,120
these years have been difficult,

73
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,480
because if we remember the year, we started

74
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,319
with the cows not doing well, with

75
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,560
some feeders that were doing well, then they

76
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,519
went badly, the  Natural gas was bringing in some

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,519
money, but then it would take it away, and there was quite a bit of

78
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,519
conflict in the market. It

79
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:27,000
wasn't very clear, and that made us

80
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,599
think, and it made us trade—or at least it made

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,080
me trade—much more cautiously than I usually do

82
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,560
. And in the end, that paid off

83
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,480
because,

84
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,040
for the year, for the year that is

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,080
this kind of, let's say, having a

86
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,239
return much, much higher than I

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,959
expected, which is

88
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,640
good, it's good. Okay, we have to keep in

89
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,680
mind that, and if you look at the curve I

90
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,519
went through, more or less, of returns from

91
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,280
when I started trading again,

92
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:04,280
and keep that in mind, a

93
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,239
spread trading curve is flat, a little bit

94
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,200
up, a little bit down.

95
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,879
You can have some dips and go down and

96
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,439
then recover, but then it has a

97
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:14,519
boom, okay? And then it

98
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,040
flattens again and then has another boom. And I think

99
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,840
Rafa also sent me one of his charts

100
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,479
of Rafa's returns. I don't

101
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,360
know, I don't know if I should post it here,

102
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,320
why not? I don't know, maybe I should talk

103
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,880
to him. Uh, and  So it's like when

104
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,360
you make these moves, okay? It's just that

105
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,960
these times come when you see you place

106
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,560
orders, you click, and you wake up—I

107
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,759
mean, you wake up, you check twice, and they're all filled

108
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,720
. You place some

109
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,320
orders, and they're all filled. And that does

110
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,120
n't always happen because, for example, for

111
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,680
me, there haven't been any orders for a week now

112
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,440
, right? It's not moving anymore,

113
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,440
right? You don't see that in your

114
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,560
portfolios either, do you? That there's nothing to do.

115
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,479
Why? Because it's the end of the year,

116
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,479
we start to accept these

117
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,000
price movements, the market doesn't move

118
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,919
as much anymore. What shouldn't we do here?

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,960
Add more lots. What do

120
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,840
you normally do? I don't trade. Oh, I don't trade. I have to do

121
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,039
something else. Oh, I have to do this or

122
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,960
that. Oh, I have to... What's happening? Oh, no, my

123
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,960
spread isn't moving. Instead of

124
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,800
adding, let me give you a basic example, one

125
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,120
lot, since it only moves 0.2, the range is

126
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
very...  Very, very narrow, I'm going to make it

127
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,919
five.

128
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Why isn't this good? Easy, because it

129
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,400
causes a range explosion, going to

130
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,080
five or three points,

131
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,560
leaving your portfolio a mess.

132
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,720
There will be times when we'll trade much

133
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,000
less. That's why it's so good. Fidel

134
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,840
was looking at the whole Excel spreadsheet you

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,360
made and saw some spreads, but I didn't have enough

136
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,520
time. That's why it's

137
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,400
so good that we're going to include some

138
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,639
intermarket spreads, which I didn't have as many of before,

139
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,199
okay? No, I didn't have that many

140
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,039
intermarket spreads, but now with the

141
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,039
solution, the platform, and everything

142
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:01,479
, I think there are two or three that

143
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:03,960
can be traded quite

144
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:07,120
intelligently, and we can keep them in our portfolio for

145
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,599
those little tweaks to keep things interesting.

146
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,759
But what you shouldn't do, what we shouldn't

147
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:15,000
do, is have no spreads.

148
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,639
In the three I see, I'll put three times more,

149
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
right? Your portfolio will flatten out, okay? But then there will

150
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,759
come another time when it goes up

151
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,400
, up a ladder, flat again,

152
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,919
up another ladder,

153
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,360
flat again.  Keep in mind that

154
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:33,800
returns sometimes—and I say this because of

155
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,240
other people—it

156
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,759
's normal to have very high figures, but then

157
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,560
the average decreases because

158
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,960
time passes and you're not making as much

159
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,560
money. So, no, that's not it, but

160
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,120
I'm fine. If you're happy,

161
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,000
that's always good. And Fidel is

162
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,199
hooked. I'm with

163
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,440
natural gas in my options account. They're

164
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,400
paying me, but you think, how can he be

165
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,879
so stupid? He says, "Sure, waiting for the

166
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,720
rebound." The typical thing a guy does when

167
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,479
the stock is plummeting, waiting for the

168
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,919
rebound. I mean, I see my heating

169
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:07,560
is on. I see I have to go out

170
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,080
and get firewood and also light the

171
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,039
fireplace because my wife likes it,

172
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,579
the kids like it, and I don't know what else. Damn, it's

173
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:17,479
cold. It's cold, but it's not cold.

174
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:20,080
[laughs] I don't know where it's cold, but

175
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:22,319
not here. Because you saw the natural gas data that came out today, and

176
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,479

177
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,120
we're way below

178
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,879
normal consumption. But you say, "[ __ ]," a

179
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,720
week ago, on Friday, it was

180
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,319
Natural gas broke out on the fifth,

181
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,400
and today natural gas is breaking

182
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:42,120
down. This is how the F contract behaves. Be

183
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,879
careful with the F contract, the

184
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,720
January contract, which is one of the most

185
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:49,199
important contracts. If you're thinking about

186
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,240
natural gas, keep in mind that the H contract, which

187
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,560
is the last one,

188
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,759
can go up, it can go

189
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,159
up 40 or 50%,

190
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,560
and it can go down much more.

191
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:04,360
Why?

192
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,680
Because it's the last contract of the

193
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,199
winter, and it's the kind of contract that if it's

194
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,039
cold, I'm going

195
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:16,919
to send to the ends of the earth

196
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:18,879
, you know? It gets cold, it

197
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,520
gets hot, or it gets hotter than

198
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,360
normal,

199
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,400
everyone liquidates positions against

200
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:30,599
it. That's why the

201
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:34,560
H, HHK, HJ, HJK, all these contracts are widow creators.

202
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:38,080
Why? Because it can become,

203
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,200
let's say, completely detached from the

204
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,039
movement of the underlying asset. Why? Because it

205
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,640
goes against stocks, and those stocks get

206
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,760
liquidated. You have to keep that in

207
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,680
mind, but

208
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,480
I'm blown away. I'm telling you the truth, I'm stunned.  I'm speechless. It's been a long time since I've

209
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,519

210
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,920

211
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,760
seen this kind of movement

212
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,519
in natural gas, and they're still

213
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,480
liquidating. Just look, they're still

214
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,680
liquidating. I have to roll now

215
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,480
because this

216
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:09,079
is a total disaster. But

217
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,040
this is natural gas.

218
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:12,480
This is natural gas. Last Friday,

219
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,560

220
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,519
breaking on Friday, and today, Tuesday, a

221
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,920
week and two days

222
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,480
later, we've broken the year's lows.

223
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,040

224
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Energy. We have to be extremely

225
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,440
careful. I

226
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,920
want to take a look at the blow I'm getting. Let's

227
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,240
see.

228
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,240
Yes, good.

229
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,360
Besides, I don't even have any

230
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:45,040
cabbages left. Ugh, I don't have any left. It's not

231
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,880
that all the cabbages and all the other stuff

232
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,800
are so low. It's dropped

233
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,920
so much that, well, at least let's

234
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,320
start cleaning up, okay?

235
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,079
Remember, I'm playing with the boil,

236
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,959
okay? What I'm going to do now is have some

237
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:04,160
chips worth 10 points.

238
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:06,959
So, let's see what the hell I do.  Let's

239
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,920
see what I do with them. But I'm going to

240
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:13,480
stay a little bullish.

241
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,480
Why? Because it's winter.

242
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,800
Oh, I wanted to mention that too. It's

243
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,079
winter here, and

244
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,360
I'm not so sure. I mean,

245
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,720
I'm not so sure, or do I want

246
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,920
gas prices to go up? No, no, I'm not so

247
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,480
sure about what I want and what's going to

248
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,000
happen either.

249
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,440
You see?

250
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,600
Now we're entering this cold snap.

251
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,680
This cold snap is real, okay? But

252
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,839
you see here, you see here that we're well

253
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,959
below the norm, but by below I mean

254
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,519
30, that is, you think that on this

255
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,360
day we should be using 30 units of

256
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,760
natural gas. I'm

257
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,079
saying it like this so as not to confuse you. The HDD is

258
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,760
heating degree days, okay? We should be

259
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,320
using 20, and uh, 30, and we're using

260
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,839
20,

261
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,680
and those days are the middle of winter and all that. I did

262
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,600
see this morning that they

263
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,959
tweeted that December will

264
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,839
break energy consumption records in the

265
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:20,959
United States.

266
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,560
And you say,

267
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,839
"Okay,  And why do you understand me?  And

268
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,800
why?  What's going to happen in the

269
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,800
next few months? Unfortunately,

270
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,720
things aren't going to improve much. I mean, man.

271
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,000
Ugh!

272
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,920
Heat, man. That's summer. I already

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,839
told you. It's summer in the United States. I don't

274
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:51,800
know what Trump has done, but this is a

275
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,920
lot, isn't it? I mean, it's a lot,

276
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,839
8 to 14 days, you see? 8 to 14 days is quite a lot

277
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,560

278
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:02,800
. It's true that the One

279
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,399
Month Outlook is on

280
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:09,800
November 30th, but

281
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,800
this report is 16 days away, and

282
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,000
I think it will go back to the cold.

283
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,560
What does that mean? Gas will go up a bit.

284
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,399
Okay, it should go up a bit, but it's

285
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,320
likely that it won't go up. Gas will go up a

286
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:29,399
bit, but the prices don't have to

287
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,399
go up that much,

288
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,160
okay? Saying this is the prices for

289
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,839
natural gas, they're all doing well. The

290
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,760
natural gas options, the ones that are bothering me,

291
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,959
I mean,

292
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,959
the prices, our

293
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,279
friend natural gas is at 189. Okay,

294
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,680
now if he opens it. Then what he's

295
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:52,279
waiting for, showing the  Guys, these are the

296
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,600
natural gas volatilities, okay? I

297
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,880
posted them in the other room, but I'm

298
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,199
putting them here because I know some of you aren't in it.

299
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:02,120
I know some of you are in the

300
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:04,360
options group, Raúl, Iván, or those of you who

301
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,320
want to be in the

302
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,920
commodities delta group too,

303
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:14,519
let me know. I'll add you, okay? Because it's not

304
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:18,079
there. Oh,

305
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,440
then look here, this is what I

306
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,720
want to show you. Look at natural gas, there

307
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,399
 

308
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:30,839
are two measures. Okay. One of the

309
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,839
measures,

310
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:44,680
this green line, is the convexity, or the

311
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,639
demand for calls, or the premium they're

312
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,000
paying for calls, okay? And

313
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,440
this is what's happening with

314
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,600
puts, okay?

315
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,240
Look how strange, look how strange

316
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,600
that

317
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,120
the puts, let's say, the demand, the

318
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,320
volatility of the put, as you want to

319
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,399
call it, has remained flat.

320
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,360
Look at the call before the rise,

321
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,000
before the rise, but here they're all

322
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,320
together, right?  They're

323
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,160
all differentiating together. Pic pack, pic

324
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,920
pack, pic pack, pic pack, pic pack.

325
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,720
Suddenly, it starts to diverge here. Look

326
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,959
how the green is going. Okay,

327
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,480
the difference is getting bigger and bigger.

328
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,320
The difference is getting bigger and bigger. And look how

329
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,320
the price of natural gas, which was

330
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,320
flat, is rising.

331
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,639
Here, it's true that they stopped

332
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,360
buying calls, they

333
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,440
stopped buying, they stopped

334
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,839
pushing the calls for more volatility, and

335
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,480
immediately, pip by pip, they bought puts

336
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,399
 

337
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,320
. There's no demand, or what do you call it? There's

338
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,920
fear that the market is going to crash,

339
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,320
right? Well, thank goodness it's only fallen

340
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,399
40%. Imagine, this is when

341
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,399
the fear kicks in. When it goes to zero, there's

342
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,480
no demand, they're not covering.

343
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,600
Why? Because they're liquidating. These are

344
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,720
futures liquidations; they've made a killing with the options

345
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,519
, okay? They

346
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,079
made a killing with the options in August, but good,

347
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,279
but the interesting thing is that these

348
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:20,079
patterns, I

349
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,320
've seen these patterns in other

350
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,360
winter rallies. Let's see, August,

351
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,360
March, 2025,  Look, in this

352
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,360
winter rally,

353
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,959
in this winter rally

354
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:35,000
last year, something very similar. Do you see it?

355
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,240
Here the price is flat,

356
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,279
volatilities drop, both

357
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,160
demands for such and such drop, and here they

358
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:45,240
start, you see, with the market. The

359
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,560
market here goes up or down, up, up,

360
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,759
up, and it goes up. That is, it goes from

361
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,880
2.4 to 4, it also doubles.

362
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:57,920
Okay. But look here also at that pattern

363
00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:02,600
of an exaggerated demand for

364
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,600
call options, and they're right.

365
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,360
And they're quite right because when you

366
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,560
see this, okay? When you see a

367
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,079
parallel movement, okay? For example, it

368
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,000
could be this here, in the end it goes up,

369
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:18,120
but it's a movement where the

370
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,399
demand for calls goes up and the demand for

371
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:26,920
puts goes up, but not here.

372
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,920
Here you see that it moves quite a bit. Here you

373
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,720
see that it moves quite a bit in

374
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,720
tandem.

375
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:40,720
These are things. I've asked a guy

376
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:42,720
who knows how to program to help me, I

377
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,440
have all that database, to

378
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,279
help me, but of course, that's 10 years' worth.  From a

379
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,759
daily database of 27

380
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:52,079
commodities, put it into a daily database, but

381
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,360
I've only asked him to put it into a

382
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,440
daily database, a database where I can

383
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,480
work with an algorithm so that he can

384
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,639
find these functions for me, because I have to

385
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,759
teach him, I have to teach him, he knows what a

386
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,400
squeeze is, he knows what it is, but I have to

387
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,199
teach him how to look at this, look at that, do this,

388
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,959
do that, because I

389
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,039
think this is quite a

390
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,679
very interesting topic, isn't it? A topic

391
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:16,480
that can be, uh, because what I said

392
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:18,280
the other day, I think there are

393
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,959
really many advantages in the

394
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,319
commodities market. Let's

395
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,199
look at what I was looking at, for

396
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:26,480
example, silver.

397
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:30,799
I know that many of us, if we look at the speed of

398
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,520
silver, okay? If we take here,

399
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,880
I know that many of us, I'm analyzing a

400
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:40,000
lot about how to take a good position,

401
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:42,280
okay? We can talk about a silver

402
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,039
squeeze. I don't think so. Why can't

403
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,559
we talk about a silver squeeze?

404
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,480
Because we see that these are

405
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,760
volatility squeezes. There's a lot of

406
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,080
volatility here, and if then  We break down this

407
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:58,640
volatility to see where it's coming from, and we can clearly see that they're

408
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,640

409
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,919
buying quite a lot. Let's see,

410
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,679
why the fuss, man?

411
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,720
Okay, they're buying, they've been

412
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,640
buying, but in tandem, but the

413
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,760
volatility of the calls is greater

414
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,320
than the volatility of the puts. That is,

415
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,919
they're pulling a lot, they're

416
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,720
pulling a lot of the market, but it's a

417
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:22,919
gradual, structural rise. You ca

418
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,960
n't really call it a

419
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:28,240
squeeze. That's why I say that having call

420
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,000
spreads in silver against put spreads

421
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,919
seems

422
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
interesting to me. Why? Because, you say, there's a

423
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:38,159
lot of demand for calls. There's an

424
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,120
excessive demand for calls, okay? As

425
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:43,120
we can see in a moment of panic,

426
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,799
even in moments of panic.

427
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,799
You see here? I do

428
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,120
n't know what I've done.

429
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,559
You see? If you see here, okay? The

430
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:13,080
put line and the call line meet. That is

431
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:15,000
, in those big drops,

432
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,159
I don't know how to use this, but it doesn't matter.

433
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,720
Uh, here you see that there's a, let's say,

434
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,679
big drop where the  The demand for

435
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:29,039
P is very much in line with the demand for

436
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:32,559
Colch, and this makes

437
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,559
the movement brutal.

438
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Okay.

439
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:44,080
For example, what I've seen with copper, there's

440
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,480
nothing, nothing, nothing out of the ordinary

441
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,640
in copper. You see? The

442
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,960
velocity of copper is completely normal.

443
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,360
If I ask for a simplified chart, the S

444
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,960
indicates buying here, okay?

445
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,919
If there's buying of calls, we see that

446
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,559
strong SQU here indicates more

447
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,919
bullish positions. Here

448
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:07,080
SKW is almost low, there's no

449
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:12,120
big difference in SKW. If we add the

450
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:15,480
downside, we see that there's even a

451
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,679
little more demand for calls,

452
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,640
but nothing

453
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,640
structural. They're all going together or very close

454
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,640
together.

455
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,960
If I look at gold, for example

456
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,320
, what do I see? In gold, I see that

457
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,159
the volatility, the peak of

458
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,520
volatility, is gone. If people have already

459
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:38,640
made money in gold, and if we add the

460
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,720
FAR and remove this to avoid having so many

461
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,640
lines, we find the same thing: it's

462
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,799
fine. F in tandem, there's no such big

463
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,280
difference.  Large like

464
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:51,360
natural gas, for example, but we see

465
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,240
that the trend in silver, as

466
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,360
you saw, continues

467
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,880
upward. We see here in

468
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,880
gold that this

469
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:03,559
exaggerated appetite to buy gold cols and

470
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,480
finance them with puts, for example, or to

471
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:07,520
have this great appetite for gold, is decreasing. It seems to

472
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,640
be structuring. That's good.

473
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,880
Why? Because we can see some things, see

474
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,760
this here?

475
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,880
We reach the top, the

476
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,240
euphoria of everyone wanting

477
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,440
gold cols collapses, okay? If you see the phoenix drop, it doesn't

478
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,520
mean the price goes down;

479
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,120
what goes down are the

480
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,840
volatility ratios, okay? And then

481
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:33,200
up again, which is

482
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,880
what volatility is, right? We see the

483
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,200
same thing happening, right? This is

484
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,760
volatility. Volatility rises,

485
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,840
we accept the high prices,

486
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,440
volatility falls,

487
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,960
volatility stabilizes, and we start again, right? Another

488
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,039
range.

489
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,919
And that's the interesting thing, okay? I see,

490
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,320
I see what else, what else do you think

491
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:56,640
with copper? I've put paradium,

492
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,480
platinum a little, and there's almost nothing.

493
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,279
We see a calm speed, if we're going

494
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,720
up, we're going up with a

495
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:08,120
drop in volatility, I

496
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,679
don't understand it. No, no, I wouldn't give much

497
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:14,360
room to this rise. Even if it

498
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:17,640
pulls back a bit, I would take positions. Let's

499
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,960
see if we're already with our friends for

500
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:23,000
corn.

501
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,039
Hyper-low volatility, but hyper,

502
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,799
super, mega low, in 3 years. Keep in

503
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:32,600
mind, this is the volatility line,

504
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:34,880
okay? The underlying is the

505
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,240
dots, which is a little like this. We're

506
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,720
in hyper-low volatility in corn, it

507
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,240
even makes me think what I can

508
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,240
do because in corn, you

509
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,960
see, I

510
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,799
would tell you, I would tell you, I would tell you

511
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,840
that making calendars in corn could

512
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:57,799
benefit you. Why? Because the

513
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:01,279
volatility is so low that you say, "Can it

514
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:03,799
go up?" Uh, everything can go up, right? But it has to go

515
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:06,679
up. Hm, I don't think so. It's  I mean, it

516
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:09,400
should go up, it should go up, but making

517
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:10,679
consecutive calendars,

518
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,799
a calendar, you know, that

519
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:14,679
benefits from a spike in

520
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,960
corn volatility, I think it could be a

521
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:18,520
good idea,

522
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,159
but since it's the end of the year, well, I

523
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,159
have to write it down because

524
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,400
soybeans, let's do soybeans.

525
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:40,600
More of the same.

526
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:47,400
More of the same. Lows.

527
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:51,360
Not quite lows, but close to lows. You

528
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,360
see? Close to lows.

529
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,840
Of course, you, why is it worth

530
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,000
trying to do something like this? Because

531
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,360
in the end it can throw you off, you can

532
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
have spikes in volatility and

533
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:12,480
benefit from those spikes.

534
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,640
Okay. Ah, Life Castle.

535
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,440
We see the panic has passed.

536
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,000
Look, we put the volatility spike

537
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,679
here. Do you know why? Do

538
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,919
you know why this cow volatility spike is because of a bottle of wine

539
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:28,880
? Look, I'm

540
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:31,279
not 100% sure, but

541
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,080
hey,

542
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:37,600
what could this spike

543
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,600
in cow volatility be from?

544
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,200
Hm.

545
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,080
Okay.

546
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,520
Year-end consumption.

547
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,520
What?

548
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,880
The price has gone down, my friend.

549
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,240
Oh, you want to water bottles of

550
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,240
wine?

551
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,640
The peak of volatility, right?

552
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,080
M.

553
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,080
What did Trump say?

554
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,279
What was it like

555
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,000
? It was what he

556
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:30,039
said when Trump opened the boot.

557
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,720
Oh, now let's see, gentlemen, do we take it as

558
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:34,000
valid or not? We take it as valid. No,

559
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,120
since it's Fidel, well, of

560
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,080
course, your mic was off. Your

561
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,240
mic was off. [laughs]

562
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,919
Of course we take it as valid. Okay, of

563
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,440
course. Fidel. Yes. When Trump said, when he

564
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:48,240
said that he would solve the

565
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,320
problem of the cows or something like that, he

566
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,399
said, of course, you keep in mind that you're

567
00:25:51,320 --> 00:26:01,039
super long with the market,

568
00:25:54,399 --> 00:26:03,120
always going up with, let's say, with

569
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,120
the prospect that there are no cows, and then

570
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,000
one of these guys comes along and

571
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,720
says, "No, no, no, I'm going to

572
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,720
solve it." He doesn't say, like you say,

573
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,039
"I'm going to unwind my position." No, no, no. And

574
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,960
I think that now, also  Let's get down to brass

575
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,760
tacks. Let's see,

576
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,000
here we should be a Don't War.

577
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,399
Right, look, look at the peak, look at the peak

578
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,399
of the puts. Okay, you see it, you see that

579
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:28,399
here you do

580
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,000
see that the puts, remember how

581
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,039
in all precious metals

582
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,919
the calls dominated? Well, you see here that the puts

583
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:49,440
start to pull you down, that is, there's

584
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:54,320
nothing. The market is rising with

585
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:56,880
low volatility, saying, uh, we'll go up, we'll go up

586
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,000
, we'll go up. And then

587
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,559
this happens, it starts to move sideways.

588
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Look how the demand for puts

589
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,480
is breaking you down. And that should give us

590
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,679
a sqw ratio, a sqw, a sqw falling.

591
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:16,679
Yes, yes, yes. Do you see that the s is falling?

592
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:19,760
Which one? What is the sqw? SQW. The s is, uh,

593
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:22,840
it indicates the volatility between a put and

594
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:27,000
a call, okay? So the s is this, the

595
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:29,080
sq of a normal sq, a sq of the

596
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,679
s  So.

597
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:37,919
You take ATM,

598
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:41,519
you take delta 25, and it

599
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,760
tells me the volatility I have

600
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:46,760
here, the volatility I have here, and

601
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,480
the ratios and convexity and all that. It does

602
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,440
n't just tell you the volatility, but it

603
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,480
tells you ratios, it tells you the

604
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,440
movement, it tells you more things. But

605
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,519
normally, the normal SQ tells you what the

606
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,720
difference is between the volatility delta 25

607
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:05,240
of a put and a call, okay? Normally,

608
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,320
a skew in the SPX always means that a put in the SPX

609
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,039
has a higher volatility than a

610
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:13,200
call in the SPX, okay? So what it

611
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:16,360
tells you, or what it

612
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,679
shows you, is which way they

613
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:22,120
're pushing. So if the skew is very

614
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:26,120
high, or if the skew is heavily towards

615
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,120
puts. Okay,

616
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:36,519
here's where it's changed.

617
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,519
Here they started buying puts.

618
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,240
They started buying puts, but they're buying

619
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,000
volatility.

620
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,880
Look at the convexity. It's

621
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,880
convexity now.

622
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,880
Ah,

623
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,720
SQw. Here, SK drops a lot. Yes,

624
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,960
of course. It drops. Why? Because it

625
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,799
starts to pull you towards, you have to pull

626
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:11,039
towards puts, the skill

627
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:11,039
increases a lot due to the volatility of puts.

628
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Hm.

629
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,640
And using the strategy of selling puts and

630
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,440
calls isn't dangerous.

631
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,120
It's a future

632
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,360
when,

633
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,600
when you buy a put and sell

634
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,720
a call, you create

635
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,559
a short future.

636
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,360
Ah,

637
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,720
okay. And when you sell a put and buy

638
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,880
a call, it's a

639
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,679
long future. It's a short future.

640
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,679
This is the

641
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,519
long one and this is the short future.

642
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,600
Okay?

643
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:59,960
The only thing is that these are strategies, you

644
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:03,600
can do it, but they are really

645
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:07,039
measures of common sense or

646
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,159
measures of, what's it called?, of

647
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,840
market behavior, because

648
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:13,279
you can immediately see when someone buys

649
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,679
a lot of puts, they

650
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:19,559
have a bad head

651
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:21,200
or a lot of hedging

652
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:25,000
or they

653
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,279
think it's going to go down.

654
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,120
So, you say, you can see it, a

655
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,399
producer can be big

656
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,880
or a big producer, but no,

657
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:34,399
speculators are usually more than a

658
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,240
Big producer, you know what I mean?

659
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,240
Yes.

660
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,360
That's about it. Okay, so

661
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:49,880
let's take a look at the

662
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,200
prices, or

663
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,880
rather, the ideas. Okay, this is going

664
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,720
up again.

665
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,159
I suppose you know

666
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,120
how that is with natural gas VXZ.

667
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,639
It's hit a low. It's

668
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,679
October, November, December.

669
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:08,519
Yes, October, November, December. It's

670
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:10,120
hitting a low. Be careful, eh, be careful. We

671
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:11,960
don't know if they'll take this back

672
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:15,159
to 250.

673
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,000
Okay, I've had some levels come in today.

674
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:17,799
Okay, I've had

675
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,880
 

676
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:24,039
18s come in. 18 and 23s.

677
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,039
I have 22s. I've had 19s come in. I've had

678
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:33,840

679
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,840
23s too.

680
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,240
Yes, I've had 19s come in today. I've had 19s come in. I've had

681
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:44,000
19s come in. I have a 28

682
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,080
here. Ah, okay. Yes. No, no, yes, it's 19 and

683
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,919
28. Yes, 19 and 28. Okay, I'll

684
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,279
get you. Let's

685
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:53,039
see, you know what it is.  Natural gas.

686
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:56,120
I think you already know gas, Mr.

687
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:57,360
Natural Gas. You have to let him

688
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,440
breathe, huh?

689
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,120
He likes to cause a lot of trouble, he likes to be a real

690
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,120
pain, right? But that's the idea, a

691
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,039
little bit.

692
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,039
The other case is having a bad time,

693
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,399
huh? I've been

694
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:16,760

695
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:16,760
thinking about the damn gas for a while now, I'm practically swallowing my food and everything, you know? But

696
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:25,480
look at this, look at this. Besides,

697
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:28,159
everyone, everyone tells us, let's see, and this is what they

698
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,600
tell you, do you know why we're

699
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,880
good at pre-market trading?

700
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:37,559
Because we're bad at trading.

701
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:40,080
Okay, let me explain.

702
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:41,880
What does a normal guy do

703
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,760
? No, here we sell,

704
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,679
buy, sell, buy,

705
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,639
sell, buy. Here we get hooked,

706
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,960
we sell more, we get hooked, we sell

707
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:54,200
more, we sell more, we sell more. Uh, and

708
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,840
here we exit, okay? If everyone exits

709
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,240
early, early, because when the

710
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,279
big drop happens, how much do you have left? Not even

711
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,039
half the position, you know?

712
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:04,559
You understand?

713
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:06,679
A trader, right?

714
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,399
What do normal traders do? Stop, stop, stop, stop,

715
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:10,880
stop. They get in and catch a

716
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,919
big trend. That's how they do it, but

717
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,559
we do it the other way around. Here

718
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:16,600
we're already in profit, and here I have

719
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,399
very few floats left,

720
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:22,320
but you're still making a lot of profit. But of

721
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:24,320
course, we make more money in

722
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,320
a sideways market than in a

723
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,240
trending one.

724
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,559
And that's why, that's why we're really bad

725
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,200
traders, because we endure everything

726
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,159
against us, and when it turns in our favor, all we

727
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,679
want to do is get out. Why?

728
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:38,733
Because, well, because you've suffered for two

729
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:40,000
months,

730
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:41,320
[laughs] right?

731
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,559
Because you've suffered for two months. You say, I'm done

732
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,559
being in. Then it goes down

733
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:49,519
. I was hoping the son of a [ __ ] would

734
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:52,760
bounce back, but of course, uh, yeah, that's it.

735
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,120
Greg was hoping it would bounce back, well, you see,

736
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:58,480
you see it doesn't bounce back, okay? I mean, it does

737
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:59,919
n't bounce back, no, no. Ah, so of course, you run into

738
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,440
the

739
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,639
problem of, well,

740
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,040
putting yourself  Now, well, no, I'm

741
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:09,800
moving on to the next ones. If there's a

742
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,159
good rebound, if there's a good rebound, for

743
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,440
example, in the middle of this month, which there might

744
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,599
be, we can try a few more short positions

745
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,040
, you know what

746
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,000
I mean? We can

747
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:24,280
buy, but look what's happened. From

748
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,480
130 to 190 and going down

749
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,480
and down.

750
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,280
Nothing, we'll stay with the

751
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,679
long positions. What I wanted to show you, I

752
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:38,040

753
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:42,159
saved, man.

754
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,159
Now we'll move on to this.

755
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,919
My friend from the trending desk told me

756
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,919
that in Arriina soybeans,

757
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:02,440
he was saying that the HK could

758
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,320
still be a long position, but the FH could be long,

759
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:09,200
okay? But I think it's too late

760
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:11,520
for this one. But the HK is late, but there's

761
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,359
demand, okay? China is starting,

762
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,359
China should start buying.

763
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,880
So this HK, okay? If it goes back to

764
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:22,000
this area, it's 3.5 or

765
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,320
4. We'll set it up now, but if it

766
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,040
goes back a little bit down here, I

767
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,640
think we could buy something. Why?

768
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,640
What? Because China might be very

769
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,920
active, might start very

770
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,920
actively buying American soybeans,

771
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,920
 

772
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:43,200
and that might help the movement a little

773
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,200
.

774
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,480
Okay,

775
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:53,839
that might help us a little.

776
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,640
This comes, I'm telling you, from the

777
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,880
guy who told me that

778
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,920
you guys who are long on the other one,

779
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,560
he says that he doesn't see the long end of the curve as

780
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,319
very

781
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,280
bullish,

782
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:10,119
because we could have an

783
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,119
overproduction of wheat,

784
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:13,640
or of

785
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,359
soybeans,

786
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,359
of soybean meal, and

787
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,359
soybean flour.

788
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,480
Okay. Ah. You

789
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,200
asked me

790
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,200
about wheat, right? You did

791
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,200
yesterday,

792
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:33,200
but it's already corrected. Yeah,

793
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,280
already corrected. Yeah

794
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,720
, man

795
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:42,319
. No, the NU, no,

796
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,319
the NU, yeah.

797
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:53,359
Look at the NUZ, how well this has done. It's

798
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,359
a good short here, huh?

799
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,119
No, we did a short here on

800
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,319
this, right? This is

801
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,480
a long, I think we did it like this

802
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:09,400
because we caught them low, right?

803
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,880
Yeah.

804
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,440
No, we sold this at five, man. Let's

805
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,640
see,

806
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:20,599
I  I think I went long and it went up, I didn't

807
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:23,160
reach the point and I got out because it was

808
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:25,119
overlapping with another one, I

809
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,520
think I also got out

810
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,160
because it was supposed to.

811
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,160
No, no, man, we're shorting

812
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,160
here,

813
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,880
see?

814
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,520
Ah, good.

815
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,040
And we caught up here, up here.

816
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,520
We caught, we caught in these. See? I

817
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:50,520
had 4.6

818
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,520
in this here. We caught here

819
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,040
and it came down, we closed it and

820
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,720
now it's going up. The only thing is, I'm

821
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:01,200

822
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,440
doing this 5.4 order like this

823
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,680
because we did enter for a while. This

824
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,599
low would have been a good

825
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,119
buy.

826
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,960
Yeah, but because of what happened, everyone's

827
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,960
smart.

828
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,960
Hm.

829
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:49,440
Put it on. You can do this, huh?

830
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:51,280
And then it notifies you, description, huh, with

831
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,119
mu,

832
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,720
ah,

833
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,720
12 - 2

834
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:08,640
at or above value minus 12.

835
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:12,359
Okay, so we have the line set up and you

836
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,359
get an email. That's very well thought out.

837
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:15,359
Okay,

838
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:24,079
that's good.

839
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:26,680
Vixes. Ah,

840
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,160
I rolled the Vix from December 28th to

841
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,839
January.  I entered at 130, okay? I entered at

842
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,400
-130. Take

843
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:37,160
a quick look at what I have in my portfolio

844
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:40,520
because, uh, I

845
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:44,599
just heard about the

846
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:46,680

847
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:47,400
 

848
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,400

849
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Lichm arbitrage buy

850
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,800
, right?

851
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,800
Uh, doing January, right?

852
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,359
Oh, no, you took it out in

853
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,560
December. Well, I started buying at 130.

854
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:07,119
You see? I have some wheat left

855
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,599
from July, from September,

856
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,880
because I had the butterfly and the

857
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,880
desce. I have that one left too, and it didn't work out

858
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,440
.

859
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:22,440
And I don't like this one because I have some left. It

860
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,440
might be too short, right?

861
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,920
What? Soybeans.

862
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,920
Oh.

863
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:35,359
Uh, the January arbitrage, right?

864
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,560
Yes, I already switched to January. Yes, yes.

865
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,680
Ah, good, good, good. I'm good.

866
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,440
So,

867
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:44,319
yes, I already switched to January. Today, it also

868
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,319
expires, keep that in mind. It

869
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:51,880
expires today. You see here in the wheat

870
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:54,319
? This, damn, in the tar

871
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:58,319
we could try to put  More. Now there are

872
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,319
a few small drops, but

873
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,880
some extras,

874
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:32,480
Was six here too, I do

875
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,480
n't mind it, eh,

876
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:45,680
because also here I said, here I said I'm out

877
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,880
, okay? I'm saved. The order didn't work for me

878
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,319
, so I'm putting it back in

879
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,640
. I mean, no means

880
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,640
no

881
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,359
in the group for people to see.

882
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,359
No. I

883
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:51,599
still like these. I'm just

884
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,200
very simple. August, October, I

885
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,040
still like these. I have nothing

886
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,800
to say. The August, October,

887
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,040
November cows are still liked. Uh,

888
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:04,040
December, February no longer  They make the

889
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:08,800
tiquitacas.  It's stuck in the

890
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,800
750 range. I'm a little lower.

891
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,359
A little further down.  December,

892
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,559
February, February, April.  No, [ __ ].

893
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,960
Livecado, August,

894
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:24,880
etc.  Feder cuts nothing.  August, October,

895
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,839
August, September, October doesn't move.

896
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:31,040
Pigs, June, August, because I have, they've already

897
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:31,040
gone, I've sold two of these.

898
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,119
Ah.

899
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,800
August 1st.  What do you mean I have two

900
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:46,800
sold?  That.

901
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:50,880
Ah, okay, because it's already bouncing,

902
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:54,359
because it has reached the first

903
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,520
level.  Yes, yes, yes.  This is fine.   It

904
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:59,599
was June.  July in Carter.  Look,

905
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:01,359
this is something to be done with your head, okay?  With your head, with your

906
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,000
head.

907
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,359
Take

908
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,960
a quick bite here.  No, very little, huh

909
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,960
?  Bit.

910
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,520
MQ.

911
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,520
Yes.

912
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,960
You have the ZG ones too, right?

913
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:45,839
Now

914
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,359
, in ZG I see that one of my ZG values ​​has disappeared

915
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,079
from my chart here, but now

916
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,079
we will look for a ZG value

917
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:07,119
because it has been deleted from my

918
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:10,760
platform.

919
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:13,920

920
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,920
The ZG has been deleted from my platform.

921
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:23,640
Yes, because, well, the ZG, the ZG does what

922
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,640
I really want it to do,

923
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:36,359
okay?  It's tikia, can you see it?  Tiki taca.

924
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:39,359
Tiki taca.  Tiki taca.  Is it clear or not

925
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:39,359
?

926
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:46,880
No fuss.

927
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:48,800
You leave your orders, they get done,

928
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,640
and you find out because I had it deleted from the

929
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,640
platform

930
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,640
.

931
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:16,319
Today, I received some shipments.

932
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:42,680
Wheat is so cheap these days, isn't it?

933
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:45,119
Look, look what they're doing.  [ __ ]

934
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:49,520
natural car.  Someday you think I'm going to

935
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,520
roll, you don't

936
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:57,680
know what I'm going to roll today, you don't know what I'm going to

937
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,680
do, right?  Up 5%.   I don't

938
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,160
care, I have to rotate by

939
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,720
position now because otherwise it's

940
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,200
very difficult to rotate them later.

941
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,079
Ah.

942
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,760
Uh, what do I mean?  What do I

943
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:15,960
mean?  Wheat, dude.  These are

944
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:19,319
, ch, I mean, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you,

945
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:22,680
the

946
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:26,839
soybean market, okay?

947
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:29,079
We hope that China, we hope China

948
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:33,400
buys.

949
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:33,400
China buys.

950
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:39,599
Hey, laughter, hey.   They're

951
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,400
broken, they're completely

952
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:45,559
broken.

953
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:49,720
There is a lot of soy, there is a

954
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:52,240

955
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:55,920
lot of soy on the market and this is

956
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:58,800
causing there not to be as much, that

957
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,720
is, there is not as much, that

958
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,800
even though China buys it, it is not much that

959
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,800
China buys.

960
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:12,440
China buys very little.

961
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,480
The same thing happens to soybeans, it happens to

962
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:20,640
corn, a little less, but it happens to

963
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:23,640
corn, it happens to the veris.  Pigs,

964
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,640
no.

965
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:31,160
Wheat.  The wheat is

966
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:34,599
sunken.  There's plenty of wheat.   A

967
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,599
lot of wheat.   I've

968
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,760
already seen the first news reports today

969
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:45,800
where they're telling us that

970
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,800
American farmers are going bankrupt.

971
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,200
Because?  They give them a lot of aid, they get

972
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,319
used to European farmers

973
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,880
who don't know what to do, and then the moment they think about it, they throw it all away

974
00:48:53,319 --> 00:48:59,799
.  all the

975
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,920
trash

976
00:48:59,799 --> 00:49:04,760
because they're not used to it.

977
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,720
Wheat at five.  Sure, they were

978
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:10,960
millionaires when wheat was at 12.

979
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,960
Now things are bad.

980
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,760
Okay, I have two types of

981
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,319
natural gas cracks, okay?  of natural gas,

982
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,160
of cracks.  Okay.  And so you can

983
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:31,680
see, I think both are good and

984
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,520
if someone wants to get them at a good price.

985
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,400
If you want, you can run for it and

986
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:39,319
then I'll let you know when to come out.  Okay, look,

987
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:42,440
this is my November gas and

988
00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:45,799
G's gas. Okay.  Look, they're both practically ready

989
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,799
.

990
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:52,200
Those are the two I have.

991
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,200
Even,

992
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:56,559
look.

993
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,000
If you want to buy them, I'll put it up for sale

994
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:15,480
so you can buy them because I think it will be at a

995
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,839
very good price.  I'm going to

996
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,839
enter the market.

997
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,960
And this one is also very good.

998
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,880
Okay.

999
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:05,599
See?

1000
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,480
If anyone wants to come in, I can tell you the

1001
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:33,119
price per person, okay?   It

1002
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:37,000
might

1003
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,000
be interesting.  Yes.

1004
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:43,280
Otherwise, there's no

1005
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,680
way to know the real price without having the

1006
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,400
data.

1007
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,720
Yes, I have

1008
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:50,280
a page that says yes, but there isn't a

1009
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:51,880
page that says you can

1010
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,240
pay for it.

1011
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:57,280
It's crystal clear.  Then there's the other thing I was going to

1012
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:00,799
ask you about.

1013
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:03,079
Ah, uh, prices are going up now, I

1014
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:06,079
got an email from

1015
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:06,079
Interactive about

1016
00:52:06,799 --> 00:52:09,280
next year's prices, right?

1017
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:11,839
Data.   Not me

1018
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,760
.  Data.  Yeah, man, you know, it's

1019
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:17,240
all about paying more.  See?  Look, you

1020
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,799
can put this one in.  This one is further away.  With

1021
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,920
this one you can, that's why there's a little more

1022
00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:24,480
fork, but you see it, you

1023
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,480
buy this one.  So,

1024
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,799
if you have data, you

1025
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:32,799
can play this because you say, "I want to

1026
00:52:29,799 --> 00:52:36,520
buy two."  Put it here in the middle and

1027
00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:36,520
see if someone will give it to you.

1028
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,000
If someone gives it to you here, you save a

1029
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:53,000
little bit of the fork here.

1030
00:52:53,240 --> 00:53:01,599
Those two points.  H, look.  And you can

1031
00:52:57,319 --> 00:53:01,599
see this if you put it like this.

1032
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,920
Okay, if you put it like this,

1033
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:18,640
okay?  If you put it like this, what you

1034
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:23,520
can do is buy this,

1035
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:26,440
remove it, okay?  Put both of them in here.

1036
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:29,119
If someone gives it to you, you take it, look at

1037
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:31,680
these three, these three here, those

1038
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:34,240
three here is, this is a price.  He's

1039
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:36,559
done an uptick.  I sell it to you here, for

1040
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:41,119
example.  So I waited here a

1041
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:41,119
little while and he was gone, son of a [ __ ].

1042
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,599
See?  Let's see if 1 3 1 3.

1043
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:00,040
The only thing is, if you do this, don't

1044
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:03,240
stop

1045
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:04,960
because it often happens that you stop and then you're left

1046
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,599
without Lois.  Let's see if it arrives on the

1047
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,599
market and makes it for me.

1048
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:15,079
This faraway one is very, very, very slow.  I

1049
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:18,160
prefer to put the order here and let him

1050
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:20,200
work on it.  It's 25, for

1051
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,880
example, to leave the order.  You don't see it here

1052
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:27,960
either.  Look, now he's come towards me.   He went down

1053
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:30,799
, he went down

1054
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:34,040
and that's what he did to me.  I could do it in three

1055
00:54:30,799 --> 00:54:38,040
.  Except for one, they are being done.

1056
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,040
The bastard won't give me this.

1057
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,440
Ah, he gave it to me right away.  Do you see it?   He

1058
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:54,040
immediately gave it to the bastard.  He gave it to me for

1059
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:54,040
650. It's okay.   Just

1060
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:04,480
keep in mind that this one moves very

1061
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:06,119
slowly, okay?  It moves very, very slowly.

1062
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,599
So, you want to put it in, for example,

1063
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:10,520
this one doesn't move at 3253, it doesn't move.

1064
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:12,520
Hitting WHL you have data.  So, you

1065
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:16,000
can look at it, you put it in, you put it in

1066
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,000
separately.

1067
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:23,240
Okay, this is

1068
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:27,039
fine,

1069
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:40,559
some natural gas, very little.  And the

1070
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:45,359
big ones are coming in.  I have nothing

1071
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:47,240
else.  Hey, guys, I think we're going to

1072
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:49,839
leave it at that

1073
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:52,119
, right?  Saying that

1074
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:55,119
a year has passed,

1075
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:55,119
eh,

1076
00:55:55,319 --> 00:56:01,920
I hope you've learned a lot

1077
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:06,138
and the next

1078
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,138
year starts very soon, so no [laughs]

1079
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,160
what my position as a trader said, right?

1080
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,039
Because you have time to rest.  So for

1081
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,039
about 10 days, because then

1082
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:17,000
the march starts again, right?  In other words, this

1083
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:20,160
never changes.  So, basically,

1084
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,880

1085
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,160
next year we'll try to do the

1086
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:27,559
same thing, a little better and with the same

1087
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:30,240
care.  Because?  Because the market, I

1088
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:32,559
think, is a little broken.  So, since

1089
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,000
the market is a bit broken,

1090
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,920
we have to tread carefully.

1091
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,039
But that's pretty much it.

1092
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:42,079
Thank you for being here with me in this

1093
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:45,440
group, and I

1094
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:47,240
really want to work with you so that I can

1095
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,359
improve

1096
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:52,720
too, because I'm quite a mess, and let's

1097
00:56:50,359 --> 00:56:55,920
see if we can all have a really

1098
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:58,640
good year next year.  And let

1099
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,160
me know if you need anything.  I'll

1100
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:04,319
be around, but I'll be more

1101
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:06,680
offline, okay?  I'll review some things,

1102
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:10,599
put in and take away orders, look at my

1103
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:12,640
nitpicks, but in principle I don't

1104
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:15,240
plan to be here these two weeks.  Besides, I'll

1105
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:19,160
go away, I'll go to the mountains with my family,

1106
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:20,319
and that's it.

1107
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,000
Okay.

1108
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:25,880
Uh, uh, tomorrow, or

1109
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:29,520
tomorrow I have to go 700 km away to sign

1110
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:31,640
a deed with my father, huh?  And I won't be there

1111
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,400
, not because I can't make it.  I even

1112
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,240
think I'm going to record a

1113
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,520
video tonight about the volatility of

1114
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:39,520
private commodities like gold and silver and

1115
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,960
what we've seen, okay?  From the

1116
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,720
silver squeiz and such, eh, and I'll leave it as a

1117
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:46,480
live stream for tomorrow, okay?  To

1118
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,680
occupy spaces.  I won't be there, I won't be there, will I

1119
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,559
?

1120
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,520
The buyer told us he wants to buy

1121
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:54,119
this year,

1122
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,280
so we just have to go and sign and that's it.

1123
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:58,400
No, there aren't many things to

1124
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:01,839
do.  I wanted to lengthen it, but no.  No, I can't

1125
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:04,799
, I can't in a way.  So

1126
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:07,480
take care.  Merry christmas.  Fidel, give me

1127
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:09,799
your address so I can send you the wine.

1128
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:12,240
Okay, also, I know you really like

1129
00:58:09,799 --> 00:58:13,839
wine.  And have you found

1130
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,760
these bottles we were looking for or

1131
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:17,480
not?

1132
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,799
The one with the bull.  No,

1133
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:21,319
from the bull.  No, you don't remember this one we

1134
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,559
caught.  Of the bull.  It was the bull's, it was.  Or

1135
00:58:21,319 --> 00:58:23,920
what?

1136
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:27,920
Of the bull.  Yes. I was trying to see if I could

1137
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:29,359
find it, and I couldn't.   You do

1138
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:33,359
n't say.

1139
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:37,200
Well, I'll send you some.  There's one, there's one,

1140
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:39,039
there's one. Let's see if I

1141
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,760
can put it on for you.   I'm telling you this

1142
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:44,960
because I have a

1143
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,960
discount from Pascual and Friends.

1144
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:50,480
Greg, I'm going to ask you a question.  The

1145
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:53,119
market closing strategy changed,

1146
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:56,960
uh, what could you do?  Any information

1147
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:57,920
regarding the warranty issue?  Of

1148
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,000
what?

1149
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,480
Regarding the guarantee you're asking me for.   Do

1150
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,119
n't look at it, man.  The truth is, I'm telling you

1151
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,240
not to look at it.  I don't know what an

1152
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,880

1153
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:09,480
invert looks like.  He asks for so much

1154
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:13,640
guarantee from a [ __ ] investor.

1155
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:16,240
But why isn't my account large, or

1156
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,720
what's the reason?   I'm

1157
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,319
taking a

1158
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,400
huge risk.  I didn't understand.  I don't

1159
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:22,920
know why you were asking for so much

1160
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,160
guarantee because it doesn't happen to me

1161
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:27,680
.  It's also true that I don't do enough

1162
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:30,920
for the account I have.  They're in

1163
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:33,920
test mode, okay?  But I think, let's see,

1164
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,920
6000,

1165
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,520
how much is the SPX?

1166
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:47,280
Can anyone tell me?

1167
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:50,680
Uh,

1168
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,680
like I said,

1169
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,880
6800

1170
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,960
index.

1171
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:09,559
Yes.

1172
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,920
795.

1173
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,240
800.

1174
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,880
 

1175
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:42,960
Why won't it show up for me?   It does

1176
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:54,799
n't tell me, it doesn't tell me how much it is. Let's

1177
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,160
see, it says initial margin

1178
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:37,640
current 56290.

1179
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:44,920
Okay, it

1180
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:44,920
says posttrade will be 55365.

1181
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:56,520
Dude, it's asking me for 1000 bucks of margin.

1182
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,839
That's weird,

1183
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:00,400
I swear, huh?  So, I think you've

1184
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:01,640
done something wrong, huh?

1185
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,240
Get on,

1186
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:05,119
come on, get on, get on one and I'll help you.

1187
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,880
Okay.

1188
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,960
Okay,

1189
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,480
if you want to

1190
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,480
share, I'll

1191
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,480
 

1192
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:18,240
leave you to it.  Do you want to share?

1193
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,240
Dale.

1194
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,839
Okay.  And that's how we look at it because this is what comes out for me

1195
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,240
 

1196
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:27,760
.  No, it's not the

1197
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:30,319
eastern margin.  We don't have to go with 10

1198
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:33,279
lots, but damn, with one or two I think we

1199
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:35,640
can try.

1200
01:02:33,279 --> 01:02:37,480
Hey, try sharing your screen.

1201
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:39,480
Yes, wait, I have to stop

1202
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:41,440
sharing.

1203
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,480
How do I stop sharing here?  Okay

1204
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,960
,

1205
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,240
I'm sharing now, right?

1206
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,240
Yes.

1207
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:53,000
That's PX as a strategy creator,

1208
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,960
right?  Down there.

1209
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,079
There.

1210
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:02,160
Okay.   This one has

1211
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:03,839
6800 purchases.

1212
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,319
6800. I will

1213
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:09,079
 

1214
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:12,079
buy this one and go to this one and sell it.

1215
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:12,079
Yes.

1216
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:13,160
Okay,

1217
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,680
 

1218
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:17,520
now add to quote panel.   There you go

1219
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,160
, you've got it.  Add to

1220
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:23,680
quote panel.

1221
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:23,680
Okay, now go upstairs.

1222
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:29,720
Click here to buy

1223
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:32,480
that 1800. Yes, this one

1224
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:34,599
.  Go to where you put

1225
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,079
to see click.

1226
01:03:34,599 --> 01:03:39,520
Well, maybe it's the ace, not the bit, but

1227
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:44,440
you can buy right right button on

1228
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:47,799
top of this right button,

1229
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:52,400
okay?  No, on top of which, okay?

1230
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:56,000
And there you have to check the

1231
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,000
performance profile and margin.

1232
01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:03,799
Close the chart, I can't see anything.

1233
01:03:59,319 --> 01:04:05,119
performance.  That?  Take it away, kill it.   He got

1234
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:07,119
this out of it.

1235
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,599
Yes, neither the one who

1236
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:11,240
wrote it did that.

1237
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:14,520
And now what happened?   He got him out

1238
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,520
.

1239
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:25,520
A valid price.   Did

1240
01:04:23,319 --> 01:04:29,760
you enter something invalid?  Okay,

1241
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:31,599
click, click.  Let's see, no.

1242
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,079
But why does he put it like that, man?  Okay

1243
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:37,119
, close it,

1244
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:38,480
close it, close it.

1245
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:41,000
Okay, you haven't set a price.  Name your

1246
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:44,520
price.

1247
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,920
Put Wait, go down, go down a lot.  Put 17.

1248
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:49,680
Minus 17, sorry,

1249
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:52,240
because I didn't give you the minimum.  That's it, that's it.

1250
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:53,799
17. No, don't send it.  Click on

1251
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,000
it.   I

1252
01:04:53,799 --> 01:04:57,160
do the same.

1253
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,160
Yes. No, further to the right or to the

1254
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,160
left.

1255
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,880
No, then go where nothing is

1256
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:08,000
written.

1257
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,599
Right button.

1258
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,640
No, but on top of that you have to be on top

1259
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,640
of the order.  Right button.

1260
01:05:13,799 --> 01:05:19,000
Well, there's checking the profile of I don't know what, I don't

1261
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:21,440
know how much.  Let's see what you say.

1262
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,799
Look,

1263
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,799
initial margin.

1264
01:05:26,359 --> 01:05:31,279
Well, he's asking you for 22,000 bucks, mate.

1265
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:41,240
And what if I...

1266
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:46,520
uh... if I think the

1267
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:46,520
margin should be there,

1268
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:50,359
but

1269
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:52,520
now you can disable it and

1270
01:05:50,359 --> 01:05:52,880
transmit,

1271
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,599
but...

1272
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,520
and I cancel it.

1273
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:58,960
Ah, yes, but just

1274
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,960
to see what happens.

1275
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:03,160
Oh,

1276
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:05,359
no, you don't have funds.  No, but it's weird,

1277
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:07,920
man, that he's asking for so much.  Is your account a

1278
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:10,640
margin account

1279
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:13,599
or a regular account?

1280
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:16,799
No, I think it's a margin.  Yes,

1281
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:20,039
I'm almost certain.  You can see it here.   I have no

1282
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:21,839
[ __ ] idea.   Do

1283
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:26,319
n't know.   Did

1284
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:26,319
you think it was a margin?  Yes.

1285
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,000
No, I don't know where it says whether the account is

1286
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:36,079
margin or not.

1287
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,279
Uh, purchasing power.  This has

1288
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:40,279
nothing to do with it.

1289
01:06:37,279 --> 01:06:40,279
No, it counts,

1290
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:46,960

1291
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,960
yes.  Yes,

1292
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:51,640
there it is.

1293
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:00,200
Let's ask someone who

1294
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:02,480
can simulate it too, to try and

1295
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:05,039
simulate it and see what they come up with, because if not, it could

1296
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:08,359
be because of the guy, because of something, because

1297
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:10,839
of the United States.  I don't know, I don't

1298
01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:13,839
know because we've put it right, haven't we

1299
01:07:10,839 --> 01:07:17,319
?  Okay, click on

1300
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:18,680
-1 and it's fine.  Reverse differential.

1301
01:07:17,319 --> 01:07:22,960
Click on the "Do

1302
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:22,960
you want to?" button.  Let's see if I can give it to you.

1303
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,880
No, it's well assembled.

1304
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,799
The floor is well installed.

1305
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:44,119
No, I don't

1306
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,760
know.   Do

1307
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:54,039
n't know.  Since you're with IB, I can't ask you

1308
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:54,039
.

1309
01:07:54,839 --> 01:08:00,720
If not, if I don't spend the other time

1310
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:02,599
I was thinking of switching to Mexem.

1311
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,920
As?

1312
01:08:02,599 --> 01:08:06,039
Last time I was about to

1313
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:10,559
switch to Mexem.

1314
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:10,559
Yeah, we're going to try to pass you, man.   I

1315
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,359
think you've

1316
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:15,960
tried to do that

1317
01:08:14,359 --> 01:08:19,600
with the new

1318
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:21,839
Mexen account number.

1319
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,080
Yes, no, no, it didn't work.  I don't know if they had that one they had

1320
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:25,759

1321
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:27,440
for people who are outside the United States

1322
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:29,440
.   I do

1323
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:33,600
n't remember how he said it, if it was Alejandro who did it

1324
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:33,600
or

1325
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:38,480
not. No, I don't remember what happened.  I

1326
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:41,440
have such a poor short-

1327
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:43,040
term memory that I don't remember if he

1328
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:46,400
had said anything to me, or if he had been able to

1329
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,400
do it or not.   I do

1330
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:53,719
 

1331
01:08:58,199 --> 01:09:02,080
n't remember this one very well.   I'll

1332
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:08,679
ask you later.

1333
01:09:06,199 --> 01:09:11,880
Wait, okay.  Yes, we'll fix you off-

1334
01:09:08,679 --> 01:09:11,880
air.

1335
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:30,279
Okay, but you have an LLC in the USA that

1336
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:33,279
has it, and you, but your LLC in the USA, but not

1337
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:33,279
them

1338
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:41,799
because you have the LLC there, but you don't,

1339
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:41,799
but it doesn't matter, you have it there.

1340
01:09:44,679 --> 01:09:52,400
Okay, we'll look at it and I'll tell you something.  Okay,

1341
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,400
fine.   I'll leave

1342
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,239
you now, gentlemen, okay?  Because I have to

1343
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:11,280
talk to Bichuencia,

1344
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:13,080
ask her about that in the USA too, and we'll

1345
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,800
see.  But this all sounds strange to me

1346
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:18,960
because, you do

1347
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:22,640
n't know, because it happens to you

1348
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,640
much more than it does to me.

1349
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:28,040
Okay, thank you.  Let's see if we can

1350
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,840
resolve that, even if it's so we can have it

1351
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:31,199
ready by next year.   See you

1352
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:34,080
later.

1353
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:37,239
Congratulations.  Thank you.  See you later.   See you

1354
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,239
later.   I'm

1355
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,600
not wearing it.  I don't have it set up,

1356
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:46,679
but I'm getting a margin of less than 1000.

1357
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:48,159
Look, my colleagues are also

1358
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:49,199
getting similar results.

1359
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:51,880
Ah, yes,

1360
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:55,679
yes.  Ask him and go,

1361
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:59,159
and I'll also send him an email.

1362
01:10:55,679 --> 01:11:01,520
I've called too, and sometimes I'll

1363
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:04,360
call again. I'm going to try to call today,

1364
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:07,239
okay?  Luck.  No, because it's strange, because it

1365
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:10,400
costs me 1000 bucks too.

1366
01:11:07,239 --> 01:11:13,840
Yes, yes, yes, yes.  I'll have that

1367
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:15,920
photo ready for you and I'll send it to you as you

1368
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,440
tell me.

1369
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,800
Okay, fine.  Perfect.  Take care and

1370
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,360
Merry Christmas.  Talk later.

1371
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,679
One question, do you have any videos or anything

1372
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,719
about this

1373
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:25,800
calendar strategy?  Exactly.

1374
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:28,080
Yes, there is

1375
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,560
one about how to set it up, and

1376
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:32,280
we always talk about them in the live streams, but

1377
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:34,520
yes, but my live stream usually catches me

1378
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:36,960
working, so I can't watch it much.  I'll

1379
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:39,719
review it, don't worry.  Uh, I think it is

1380
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:42,120
an Alejandro, it's an

1381
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:42,960
inverted calendar where I put 55.

1382
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,480
Yes, yes, yes, yes.   It

1383
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:47,159
usually turns out like this.  There is a

1384
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,880
video of how the calendar is put together,

1385
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:50,639
but I haven't made a video specifically about

1386
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,320
the strategy because there isn't much

1387
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:55,000
more to it.  I can't backtest it because

1388
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:57,040
the backtests aren't showing up.  Uh, we have 10

1389
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,080
operations where one has failed or 11

1390
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:01,719
operations where one has failed, and

1391
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:05,120
there are always 55. I also look at how the day is going.

1392
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:07,400
How much is that loss?

1393
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:10,120
150 per batch more or less.

1394
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:12,639
And when exactly is the exit?   You

1395
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:14,719
set a

1396
01:12:12,639 --> 01:12:16,880
goal of 45 or 50 bucks, then you quit and

1397
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:18,600
leave.  Okay, okay, okay.

1398
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,639
No, normally it happens to me, you see, at

1399
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:24,639
midnight, at 1 a.m.,

1400
01:12:21,639 --> 01:12:27,440
at 3 a.m., it does it on its own.

1401
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:28,400
Yes, it's a one-day and two-day thing,

1402
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:33,159
basically.

1403
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:36,159
Yes, it's buying the next day and selling

1404
01:12:33,159 --> 01:12:38,080
two days later.  The one at what level,

1405
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:39,960
ATM.  ATM, no,

1406
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:43,199
yes, I lock it up, I set up two or three

1407
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:45,000
levels because there are 40 to 50, I set up three

1408
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:47,159
levels depending on how it moves,

1409
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,080
okay?  You set up the levels, so

1410
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:51,080
more or less the one you have closest or

1411
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:55,840
the one you choose, okay?  In other words, if it

1412
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:59,199
's at 87 now, then you can choose

1413
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:02,040
85 or

1414
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:04,480
90, you understand?  You choose which one you

1415
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,920
want because you don't know, you

1416
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,840
understand?

1417
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,360
Yes. In the end, it's between days, that's

1418
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:10,320
the difference.

1419
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:12,360
Yes, it is, and then I enter it, and the

1420
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,880
moment you enter it, don't leave it in

1421
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:16,880
overnight mode because I have six or seven

1422
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:19,040
operations that I have exited before

1423
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,040
closing time.

1424
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:24,159
Because?  Because typical

1425
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:26,560
strong, abrupt market movements

1426
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:28,040
make you very fast.  As the

1427
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:30,960
forks open, sometimes you make the

1428
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:32,280
movement.

1429
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,239
And what we're saying is that it

1430
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:38,040
probably

1431
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:40,880
came out due to some kind of

1432
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:43,600
valuation error or something, because, like,

1433
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:47,120
I had a target of 50 bucks and they did it

1434
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:49,679
for 100.

1435
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,440
And they did it for 100. For now,

1436
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:53,639
when I see it said if we're at a

1437
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:56,719
support level, for example, imagine that Alma

1438
01:13:53,639 --> 01:13:59,120
marked a weekly support level and we're at

1439
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:00,560
the support or resistance level, I don't

1440
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,000
include it.  Because?  Because we might be

1441
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,800
playing with her.  Or I also see that there are some

1442
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,639
on the market, but I'll usually

1443
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,639
publish them whenever I can.

1444
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,800
Okay,

1445
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,400
okay, okay.  Yes, yes.

1446
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,400
Brilliant.  Come on, take care.
